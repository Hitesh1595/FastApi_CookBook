## Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a powerful design pattern for managing dependencies between components in FastAPI applications. It enables efficient management and injection of dependencies such as database connections, authentication services, and configuration settings into endpoints and middleware.

### Key Features
- Manage database connections efficiently
- Handle authentication services
- Inject configuration settings
- Support for nested dependency injections

## Internationalization and Localization

Implement multi-language support in your FastAPI applications using Babel.

### Installation
```bash
pip install babel
```

### Resources
- [Babel Documentation](https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/)

## Performance Optimization

Optimize your FastAPI application performance using profiling tools and best practices.

### Installation
```bash
pip install pyinstrument
```

### Optimization Techniques

#### Asynchronous Programming
Utilize asynchronous programming to handle concurrent requests efficiently. FastAPI, built on top of Starlette, supports asynchronous request handlers using `async` and `await` keywords. This maximizes CPU and I/O utilization, reducing response times and improving scalability.

#### Scaling Uvicorn Workers
Increase the number of Uvicorn workers to distribute incoming requests across multiple processes. However, for purely I/O operations, asynchronous programming may be more effective than adding workers. Monitor CPU usage before scaling workers.

#### Caching
Implement caching mechanisms to store and reuse frequently accessed data, reducing database queries and computation overhead. Use dedicated caching libraries for FastAPI integration.

## Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests clients can make to your API endpoints.

### Installation
```bash
pip install slowapi
```

## Background Tasks

Implement background tasks for non-blocking operations that don't need to complete before returning a response to the client.

### How It Works
When a request is made to an endpoint, background tasks are enqueued to the `BackgroundTasks` object. All tasks are passed to the event loop for concurrent execution, enabling non-blocking I/O operations.

### When to Use Alternatives
For tasks requiring significant processing power that don't need to be completed by the same process, consider using more robust tools like Celery.
