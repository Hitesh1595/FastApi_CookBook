You will learn how to utilize the FastAPI CLI to run your server efficiently, enabling HTTPS to
secure your applications, and containerizing your FastAPI projects with Docker. Additionally,
we will explore techniques for scaling your applications across multiple workers, packaging your
applications for distribution, and deploying them on cloud platforms such as Railway. Each recipe
in this chapter provides step-by-step instructions, practical examples, and insights into optimizing
your deployment workflow.
By the end of this chapter, you will be proficient in deploying FastAPI applications using modern
tools and methodologies. You’ll be able to always secure your applications with HTTPS, run them in
Docker containers, scale them with multiple workers, and deploy them on the cloud. These skills are
invaluable for any developer aiming to take their FastAPI applications from development to production.
