Setting up WebSockets in FastAPI


You can check how to create a WebSocket endpoint on the FastAPI official documentation page:

At the time of writing, the Swagger documentation does not support WebSocket endpoints. If you
spin up the server and open Swagger at http://localhost:8000/docs, you won’t see the
endpoint we have just created. A discussion is ongoing on the FastAPI GitHub repository – you can
follow it at the following URL:
