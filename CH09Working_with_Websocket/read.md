## Working with WebSockets

WebSockets provide real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. This section covers comprehensive WebSocket implementation in FastAPI applications.

### Setting up WebSockets in FastAPI

Learn how to create WebSocket endpoints in FastAPI for real-time communication.

#### Important Notes
- **Swagger Documentation**: WebSocket endpoints are not currently supported in Swagger UI. When you access `http://localhost:8000/docs`, WebSocket endpoints won't be visible.
- **Development Status**: This is an ongoing discussion in the FastAPI community.

### Sending and Receiving Messages over WebSockets

Implement bidirectional message exchange between clients and servers using WebSocket connections.

### Handling WebSocket Connections and Disconnections

Manage client connections and disconnections gracefully to maintain application stability.

### Handling WebSocket Errors and Exceptions

Implement robust error handling for WebSocket communications to ensure reliable real-time features.

### Implementing Chat Functionality with WebSocket

Build real-time chat applications using WebSocket connections for instant messaging capabilities.

### Optimizing WebSocket Performance

#### Performance Testing and Benchmarking

Test your WebSocket endpoints with multiple concurrent connections to understand performance limits. You can create benchmarking scripts to test connection limits by varying the `n_clients` parameter.

**Key Observations:**
- With default client numbers, messages flow smoothly
- Increasing concurrent clients eventually leads to socket connection errors
- Connection limits depend on your machine's capabilities

#### Performance Optimization Checklist

**Unit Testing**
- Use FastAPI's `TestClient` for WebSocket unit tests
- Ensure endpoint behavior remains consistent during development
- Validate WebSocket functionality with automated tests

**Error Handling Best Practices**
- Implement graceful error handling with try/except blocks
- Use `async for` instead of `while True` when possible for automatic disconnection error handling
- Handle specific error conditions appropriately

**Connection Management**
- Use connection pool managers for multiple client scenarios
- Implement efficient connection pooling for chat applications
- Improve performance and code maintainability

### Securing WebSocket Connections with OAuth2

Implement authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections using OAuth2.

#### Current Development Status
OAuth2 integration with WebSockets is an active area of development in the FastAPI ecosystem. The implementation of OAuth2PasswordBearer-like classes for WebSockets is evolving rapidly.

### WebSocket Best Practices

1. **Testing Strategy**: Always implement comprehensive unit tests for WebSocket endpoints
2. **Error Resilience**: Build robust error handling mechanisms
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Regular benchmarking to understand connection limits
4. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Connection Management**: Use appropriate connection pooling strategies
6. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of connections and resources
