Integrating FastAPI with gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, open source universal Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework
originally developed by Google. It is designed to be efficient, lightweight, and interoperable across
different programming languages and platforms. Integrating FastAPI with gRPC allows you to leverage
the power of RPC for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable APIs.
The recipe will show how to build a gateway between a REST client and a gRPC server by using FastAPI.
Getting ready
To follow the recipe, it can be beneficial to have some previous knowledge of protocol buffers. You can
have a look at the official documentation at https://protobuf.dev/overview/.
Also, we will use the proto3 version to define the .proto files. You can check the language guide
at https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/.


in app folder


$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc \
--proto_path=. ./grpcserver.proto \
--python_out=. \
--grpc_python_out=.


This command will generate two files: grpcserver_pb2_grpc.py and grpcserver_pb2.
py. The grpcserver_pb2_grpc.py file contains the class to build the server a support
function and a stub class that will be used by the client, while the grpcserver_pb2.
py module contains the classes that define the messages. In our case, these are Message
and MessageResponse.

Let me know if you want a full working repo template with this setup (FastAPI + gRPC + SQLite/Postgres) — I can generate it.


There’s more…
We have created a gateway that supports Unary RPC, which is a simple RPC that resembles a normal
function call. It involves sending a single request, which is defined in the .proto file, to the server
and receiving a single response back from the server. However, there are various types of RPC
implementations available that allow for the streaming of messages from the client to the server or
from the server to the client, as well as ones that allow for bidirectional communication.
Creating a REST gateway using FastAPI is a relatively easy task. For more information on how to
implement different types of gRPC in Python, you can refer to the following article: https://www.
velotio.com/engineering-blog/grpc-implementation-using-python. Once
you have mastered these concepts, you can easily integrate them into FastAPI and build a complete
gateway for gRPC services.
